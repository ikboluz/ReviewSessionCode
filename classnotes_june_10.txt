Sunday Review session.

When file newly added to git local repository:
1) Untracked status when file is just added.
If we want to commit that file:

2)We need add to Staging area/Index. git add command

3)Commit 

git remote add origin https://github.com/CybertekSchool/ReviewSessionsCode.git

--> link local repo to remote repo


git push -u origin master

VCM -VERSION CONTROL MANAGMENT TOOLS

GIT, CVS, SVN

BITBUCKET, GITHUB, GITLAB
============================

How do you do code review?

Elvira: Everyone in the team joins the webinar and developer/you present
your code in your IDE(Eclipse, IntelliJ).

Once approved by everyone -> Code is pushed to remote repo and 
everyone can now pull and use it.
=============================

I worked in projects where I had to test different application layers:
1) Front end layer/UI automation -> Selenium WebDriver
2) API layer/RESTful API -> Postman, RestAssured
3) Database layer/Relational database -> Oracle 11G.
	SQL -> JDBC




How do you test API service?
----------------------------

To test API service I send requests to API endpoints and verify response
from Rest API.

After learning about RESTFul API endpoint URLs, I send POST,GET,PUT, DELETE type of Http requests/calls to those URLS and verify/assert the response according to user story/requirement.

In some scenarios - I make sure API response data matches the values in database.

Our developers set up Swagger UI and we can see full endpoints and sample request/response there.
======================


How do you validate your response from your API?
------------------------------------------------
REQUEST: header: Accepttype, COntentType, authentication etc
	Request body for NON get request
	Params


RESPONSE: Status code/Status line
		  JSON/XML Body
		  Content type

I design my test according to what is expected/requirements:

Firstly I assert the Status code. It could be 200, 201, 400 etc.

Then I validate JSON/XML Body according to requirements.

I automate this process using Java RestAssured library
and for assertions I use -> hamcrest matchers or Junit
/ testNG asssertions.

I make sure each key in the JSOn response body contains
expected value:

 "id": 4,
 "first_name": "Eve",
"last_name": "Holt",
"avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/marcoramires/128.jpg"
===========================

When are you testing your service and your received 500 error and how would you debug it?

if i have access to application backend logs then 
i go and go through the logs and try to find the reason.

If not, I will raise a bug/ticket/issue or ask development team to take a look, so they take a look and let me know.
It could be api code issue or I sent some wrong request and api code could not handle it.
-----------
400 BAD REQUEST
401 Unauthorized, check credentials
--------------

Authorization/Authentication
============================

1) Simple username and password that you send 
in your request as query params. as headers

RestAssured:
given().auth().basic(userName, password)
		.when().get();

given().auth().preemptive().basic(userName, password)
		.when().get();	

2) OAuth 2.0 authentication. 
   OAuth 2.0 server generate unique access token for the user. then I can send that access token in my 
   request header.

   It can be generated manually or everytime user tries to login top application server will authenticate the user then OAth 2 server will generate token for the user. 

   

given().header("Authorization", "Bearer 10960~07alELbC11w2DpnwzQ1rwfJb8M5u9wqDpoRfG57DWSxnjJAVmB1evcyfvZARz4EP")
		.when().get("https://learn.cybertekschool.com/api/v1/accounts/self/users")
		.thenReturn().body().prettyPrint();
